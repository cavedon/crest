1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:05,940
So it was my vision from the beginning
that this tool would be an open source

2
00:00:05,941 --> 00:00:10,560
tool. It's really important to understand
that a lot of people don't have the

3
00:00:10,561 --> 00:00:15,420
resources to go out and buy
expensive tools to test their

4
00:00:15,421 --> 00:00:17,970
products for accessibility. And likewise,

5
00:00:17,971 --> 00:00:21,810
they don't have the time to sit
there and do everything manually.

6
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:26,250
The idea was to take
things that were really

7
00:00:26,251 --> 00:00:30,870
tedious and to try to automate
them in a way that they couldn't be

8
00:00:30,871 --> 00:00:34,320
automated it using current
code inspection techniques,

9
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,040
largely because there wasn't
any data to be manipulated.

10
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:40,230
And that's what assistive
technology is all about.

11
00:00:40,231 --> 00:00:44,490
It's making sure that people with
disabilities can use the data,

12
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:46,740
but using their system technology.

13
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,540
So my vision was to find
problems sooner, uh,

14
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,460
to not have a cost associated
with them and to give people

15
00:00:56,461 --> 00:01:00,870
time to focus on accessibility
features that are fun and

16
00:01:00,871 --> 00:01:05,550
innovative and not have to sit there and
hit the tab button 87 times to figure

17
00:01:05,551 --> 00:01:07,680
out if everything was
keyboard accessible or not.

18
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:14,060
So I'll be talking about my
experience working in this area,

19
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:19,820
uh, since I did not have a
background of accessibility.

20
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,570
So it has not only added
exposure in my career,

21
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,550
but also helped me to understand the
importance of accessibility since

22
00:01:28,551 --> 00:01:32,960
the automated accessibility testing using
machine learning is a developing area.

23
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,070
And I really enjoyed being in
this challenging environment.

24
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:42,020
It helped me to come up with my novel
solutions to do something for our

25
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,930
society. And, uh, apart from that,

26
00:01:44,931 --> 00:01:49,310
I got to learn the different phases of
software development that I think it

27
00:01:49,311 --> 00:01:51,080
would definitely help me in the future.

28
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,830
So there's a number of ways that people
can contribute to this project going

29
00:01:57,831 --> 00:02:02,120
forward, thinking of those
methods in terms of t-shirt sizes,

30
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:05,150
we'll start with extra small
and go up to extra large.

31
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,910
One of the things is we would like it.

32
00:02:07,911 --> 00:02:10,820
If people contributed to the data model,

33
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:15,500
if you have a good generic data
model that you've built using your

34
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:16,483
execution,

35
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:21,470
want to contribute that we can
integrate that in with the products. Um,

36
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:26,480
also if you find things that we
didn't anticipate, like let's say, uh,

37
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:28,700
there's a particular
keyboard focus pattern.

38
00:02:28,701 --> 00:02:33,160
That's legitimate that we're not giving
the right results for, for some reason,

39
00:02:33,161 --> 00:02:37,970
reporting those things will allow us
to refine the code in order to produce

40
00:02:37,971 --> 00:02:39,620
better results going forward.

41
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:43,340
In terms of medium-sized contributions,

42
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:48,230
we have identified 26 things that
we want to add to this product

43
00:02:48,231 --> 00:02:52,970
above and beyond the five that are
already there and taking one of those on

44
00:02:52,971 --> 00:02:56,240
as either an individual or
as a team of individuals,

45
00:02:56,241 --> 00:03:00,640
maybe a master's degree project or
something like that, be definitely doable.

46
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:04,660
And then for, uh, the extra large, uh,

47
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:06,340
people who work for larger companies,

48
00:03:06,341 --> 00:03:10,870
we have had offers of for
contribution of resources.

49
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:15,340
So we will be getting additional
machine learning resources, for example,

50
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:19,210
um, and, uh, design reviews
and things like that.

51
00:03:19,211 --> 00:03:23,110
So if you want to participate on a
larger level, that's available as well.

52
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,630
So to contribute to this project,

53
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,410
people can go and look at open
issues in the Gator rappel.

54
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,900
Then they can select issue that interests
them and raise a pull request in the

55
00:03:36,901 --> 00:03:40,200
format, defined in the
contribution dot time defile.

56
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:45,600
Then moderator will review the changes
and comment if anything needs to be

57
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:48,810
changed. And, uh, once changes are done,

58
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:52,830
the contribution will be added to the
project and can be seen in the upcoming

59
00:03:52,831 --> 00:03:53,664
versions.

60
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:59,370
There area where you can
contribute is in dashboarding.

61
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,020
We will be taking some of the
pieces from the VMware testing as a

62
00:04:04,021 --> 00:04:07,590
service product, and those are going
to be released into open source.

63
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:12,630
So if you have any experience with
doing accessible test harnesses

64
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:16,830
or accessible dashboarding
of testing results, uh,

65
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,650
those would be, uh, quite
well received as well.

66
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:22,260
And if you can't contribute anything,

67
00:04:22,261 --> 00:04:26,610
but you have an idea that you think is
really important, open a ticket and get,

68
00:04:26,611 --> 00:04:27,840
and we'll look at it,

69
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,560
explain why you think it's important
and you talk to your friends about it.

70
00:04:31,561 --> 00:04:36,240
If they can add their comments
to your tickets as well,

71
00:04:36,241 --> 00:04:39,300
to show a widespread
support for your idea.
